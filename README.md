# 👋 Hi, I'm Gopal

Welcome to my GitHub. This is where I experiment, break things, and build them back—smarter.

## 🧠 Focus Areas

- ⚙️ **AI Automation**  
  Exploring how LLMs and task-specific agents can simplify business ops, particularly within hospitality and spiritual communities like Krishna Village.

- 🌐 **Web Deployment & Systems Testing**  
  Trialling full-stack web setups, from local test environments to public deployments. Think fail-fast, iterate faster.

- 🕉️ **Krishna Village DevOps**  
  Custom automation and tooling for Krishna Village: streamlining invoicing, compliance, and internal systems using the Microsoft ecosystem + AI.

## 🚧 Work In Progress

|--------|-------------|
| `kv-website-tests` | Deployment prototypes for Krishna Village – testing front-end + backend stacks |
| `ai-ops-bot` | Agentic framework to automate routine business tasks (HR, accounts, OH&S) |
| `notion-consequence-engine` | Daily habit tracker with automation-driven consequence logic, powered by Notion formulas |
