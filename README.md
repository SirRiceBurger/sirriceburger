# Gopal Reissenberger

I build quantitative + ML systems that make decisions under uncertainty.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of:
- **Quantitative finance** (systematic research, market modelling)
- **Machine learning** (experiments, optimisation, applied RL)
- **High-performance computation** (C++/Python, large-scale runs, efficiency)

## Current Focus
- **Algorithmic trading research**: backtesting, signal design, execution logic
- **ML projects**: training loops, evaluation pipelines, model iteration
- **Mathematical Research**: large computations + algorithmic improvements

## Projects
- **Trading Systems & Research** → strategy prototypes, analytics, infrastructure  
- **ML / Reinforcement Learning** → experimentation + performance tuning  
- **Computational Number Theory** → high-scale compute + verification work  

## Stack
**Languages:** C++, Python, HTML, CSS  
**Tools:** Git, NumPy, Matplotlib, basic data pipelines  
**Interests:** optimisation, probability, market microstructure, scalable systems
