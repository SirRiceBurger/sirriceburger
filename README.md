### Skyblock Casino Engineering • Regulation • Fairness Analytics

Welcome to the repository hub for Skyblock’s most audited gambling infrastructure.

This space documents the systems, standards, mathematical models and verification tools used to certify casinos across the network. Every certified operator is listed with technical profiles, probability graphs, expected value breakdowns, and compliance history.

This is the regulatory and engineering backbone for gambling economics on Skyblock.

## 🔧 What I Do

✔ Design casino systems    
✔ Publish fairness proofs and odds charts  
✔ Certify casino operators through audit  
✔ Maintain transparency registries    

Casinos wanting legitimacy and high-stake traffic rely on these frameworks.

## 📊 The Public Registry

Each certified casino receives:

- A documentation page  
- Breakdown of odds and payout curves  
- House edge and expected value analysis  
- Verification logs  
- Fairness methodology  
- Risk alerts and recommended maintenance cycles  

This acts as the trust layer between owners and players.

## 🔐 Compliance Standards

All certification follows core principles:

1. Verifiable randomisation  
2. Transparent payout logic   

Failure incidents and response resolutions are recorded publicly.

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Skyblock has casinos everywhere, but very few earn trust.

Players deserve:

- Transparent math  
- Predictable behaviour  
- Proof of safety  

Owners benefit from:

- More high-roller traffic  
- Reputation  
- Reduced disputes  

This repository is where those interests meet.
